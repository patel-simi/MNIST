# Image MNIST Classification
Takes the builtin TensorFlow dataset, MNIST, and applied the Convolutional Neural Network to test the accuracy at detecting the handwritten digits with a 99% accuracy. This model consists of techniques that prevent the overfitting of the model with the assistance of batch normalizaiton, and dropout methods.
Illustrates basic CNN structures using tensorflow including methods that regularize and normalize the data along the way to avoid overfitting the dataset.

### User Instruction
This file is a Python notebook and that supports the display of a python program. They include notes alongside the code to help comprehend the codes use along the way.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
CNN are machine learning took that are used on a specific class of data that is organized in a matrix such as grid-like data and images. They use pooling layers and fully connected layers to identify patterns within the data. They have weights and biases within each neuron that gets processed within the activation layer to produce an output that contributes to the next layer of neurons.
